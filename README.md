# Node Samples using Clean Architecture concepts

_This application is boilerplate to future implementations using clean architecture with TDD_

## Disclaimer

- The concepts and the application presented here is not an absolute truth, is only my opinion with basic architecture concepts that i learned with my works and my studies. If someone has some different opinions, feel free to create an issues so we can talk, i always want to learn more ;)

- This application implements same business logic, user registration (signup) and user session (signin). The principle idea is, when we follow best developments practices, when we need to change some frameworks, database or or anything external does not impact our application
